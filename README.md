# React optimization examples

A set of very simple optimization examples for `React`. 

It uses:
- `memo` HOC
- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`

This repo contains *good examples* preceded with *bad examples*. Check console how often child components are re-rendered on parent state change etc.

> Always use optimization hooks as last resort! Do not over optimize!

Sorry for the ugly component names! This was written during speed coding session (no time for refactoring) ðŸ’©
